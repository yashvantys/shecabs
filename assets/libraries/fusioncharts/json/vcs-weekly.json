I live in Virginia & saw him at his McLean, VA office & had surgery at Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington. Great surgeon--great hospital!  His office schedules appointments & surgeries much faster than other northern VA gyn/onc specialists.  He is an expert in laparoscopic surgery & has privileges at many NoVa/DC/MD hospitals. His manner is courteous & comfortable & he listens & answers your questions.  I was very nervous & stressed, & he explained everything to me completely & made me feel totally at ease with the surgery. I was scheduled for the operation 2 days after seeing Dr. MacKoul.  Everything went even better than expected. It was amazing! No pain - no complications. Again, I highly recommend Dr. MacKoul & his surgical team & Virginia Hospital Center. ",

Makes it super efficient to get copies, prescriptions, ensure that other doctors get all the info., etc.  Liked that he was cautious about making a diagnosis  until all tests were in, but put me on some medication immediately that could be adjusted later.  I had a lot of questions and he was patient about answering--without the  condesending attitude that one often sees.  Have had two other doctors comment regarding his skills \"He's very good...good choice, etc.\"\nNone, although it would have been nice to get in a little earlier for the first appointment.\nOffice is very well organized and well run.  Have usually had to wait 15-20 minutes but that seems pretty standard practice in DC area.   Think that is partly a means to ensure patients are there so Dr. doesn't have to wait.\n&check;  I waited for about 15 minutes at the office before seeing the doctor.\n&check;  I recommend this doctor.\n Overall Rating : 5/5.0.

My evaluation with Anne Wellington-Goldsmith is by far the most thorough per-treatment exam I have ever had!    Anne never rushed me, she was so detailed and precise in her History taking and physical exam.   \r\n\r\n      Throughout these past weeks of treatment, I have become so much more informed as to how to not only approach my healing, but to continue on post recovery, empowered with the knowledge of how to prevent any exacerbation of the issue I presented with.\r\n\r\n      I am so grateful to Anne & staff for their expertise.  The auxiliary therapists in this practice have been a pleasure to work with also.\r\n\r\n     Thank you all!\r\nRhonda Joseph",
